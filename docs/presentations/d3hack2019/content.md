# `ocrd_segment`

## Data-driven page segmentation

Janek Schleicher, Robert Sachunsky, Kay-Michael WÃ¼rzner

---

# The task

  1. Segment pages of printed documents
  2. Classify the segments according to their layout-semantic function

# The task

# The data

1. 180,000 annotated pages from the periodical *Die Grenzboten* (1841-1922)
  - Homogeneous layout
  - Completely annotated on page **and** volume level
2. 25,000 annotated pages from XXX volumes of the *German Text Archive* (1506-1899)
  - Heterogeneous layout
  - Incompletely annotated on page **and** volume level
3. 1,000 annotated pages from 230 volumes of the *German Text Archive* (????-????)
  - Heterogeneous layout
  - Completely annotated on page (but not on volume) level

# Some questions

Build a data-driven framework with neural networks which performs the task of page segmentation and segment classification.

- Level of representation (pixel, coordinates ...)?
- General architecture (one or multiple classifiers)?
- Network architecture?
- Preprocessing and/or augmentation methods?
